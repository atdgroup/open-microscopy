The dcamapi.lib file used in ATD_Dlls\trunk must match the h files in ATD_Hardware\Camera\trunk\dcam and be appropriate for the driver (API) installed.
Extract appropriate matching files from the dcamapi folder.

The API will install dcamapi.dll in system32 and so it should not be present here.

Matching sets are:

2008 - known to work for older Orca ER(G) cameras
API March 2008
SDK Oct 2008


2010 - required for newer cameras
API Nov 2010
SDK May 2010 beta

2013 - required for WIndows 7 ? - This seems to be different, e.g. does not have features.h, so far using ver 2010 on Win7 32 bit.
DCAM-API for Windows (14.3.4514)
DCAM SDK for Windows (13.10.4418), 2013-10
