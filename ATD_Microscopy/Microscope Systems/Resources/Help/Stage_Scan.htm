<h2>Stage scan</h2>
<br>
A stage scan gives the user a <a href="Realtime_overview.htm">realtime
overview</a> (without the need of moving the joystick). A rough overview
map of the sample within the defined ROI is produced. This can be saved 
or used as a navigation aid. The camera will be put into a short-exposure 
fast imaging mode for the scan, you can adjust the gain before the start
of the scan if images turn out too light or dark (in a trial and error 
fashion).<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Speed</span> - If the stage is 
too slow or fast for the camera acquisition rate, the speed can be changed here
before a scan is started. If the mosaic has vertical line/gaps between images, 
slow down the stage<br>
