<h2>Stage</h2>
The most basic function of the stage panel is to display the current
stage position, which is constantly being read.<br>

Datum<br>
</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>The datum is the
center point of the stage and we define it as (0,0) in X and Y; it
also called a Datum. For convenience, the user may
want to re-define the Datum. For
example, suppose a group of cells to be scanned lies away from the
Datum. Rather than moving the stage around,
and noting the new X and Y values at the edges of the ROI, it is often
easier to set the center of the ROI as the new Datum. This enables
to&nbsp; begin a scan using symmetric edge co-ordinates e.g.
-2000 to 2000 in both X and Y. If a scan has to be repeated over a
larger or smaller area it is a simple matter of adjusting these numbers
(to say -3000 to 3000) rather than re-calculating the new edge
co-ordinates (in terms of the old Datum).&nbsp;The downside of
redefining a new Datum is that the absolute co-ordinates have now been
lost. Therefore, if
the same sample needs to be revisited while&nbsp;the system has been
turned off, upon re-initialisation (of the stage) the &nbsp;Datum will
be set as the center of the X and Y axis. One way of overcoming
this&nbsp;is to note the X and Y values before the new datum
was set, then the process can be repeated.<br>

Clicking the mouse anywhere on this diagram will move the stage to that
position, green boxes denote the limits of its travel.<br>
<br>

</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>When the joystick
is enabled the light is on.&nbsp;It is possible to change the speed of
the stage.&nbsp;<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Settings...</span> - This
will open an extended control panel which is currently password
protected (contact Administrator to change these settings)<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Re-Initialise</span>
-&nbsp;Re-initialisation drives the stage to its limits, set by limit
switches (green boxes on Datum diagram). Then it will drive to a
position, determined by software,
which will be used as the datum, position (0,0).<br>
