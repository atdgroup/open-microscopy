<h2>Microscope
overview</h2>
The main microscope panel provides the most commonly used controls.
More options are available via the <a href="Components.htm">components</a>
tab where individual hardware elements can be controlled. The <a
 href="Configure.htm">configure</a> tab
offers some calibration possibilities.<br>

<b><big>Microscope<br>
<br>
</big>Mode </b>- once a mode is chosen the path, camera settings,
shutter settings and cube (to some extent) will be chosen automatically.<b><br>
</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fluorescence</span> - in
this mode we illuminate the sample with the <a href="Lamp.htm">lamp</a>
using Epillumination&nbsp;(bright field illumination of a sample by
transmitted light), the light goes through a <a href="Flour_cubes.htm">fluorescence
cube</a> and is imaged onto the <a href="camera.htm">camera</a>.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bright Field</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - </span>in this mode we illuminate the
sample with either room lights or the
LED array using Transillumination&nbsp;(light is passed from below
through the <a href="objectives.htm">objective lens</a> and then onto
the sample), the light goes through a&nbsp;<a href="Flour_cubes.htm">fluorescence
cube</a>
and is imaged onto the <a href="camera.htm">camera</a>.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laser Scanning</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - </span>this is the mode used for
Confocal and FLIM measurements. In this mode we use the <a
 href="White_laser.htm">laser</a> for excitation,&nbsp;the light goes
through a <a href="Flour_cubes.htm">fluorescence&nbsp;cube</a>
(normally done with UV - 2A) and the detection is done with the&nbsp;<a
 href="Pmts.htm">PMT</a> detector with the correct <a
 href="Filters.htm">filter set</a> in front of it.<b><br>
<br>
Cube</b> - there are currently three <a href="Flour_cubes.htm">fluorescence
cubes</a> present.<br>
<b><br>
Path - </b>this refers to the detection path.<b><br>
</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laser scan</span> - when
the laser scanning mode is chosen the detection is done by the&nbsp;<a
 href="Pmts.htm">PMT</a>. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Colour camera</span> - not
yet available. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Camera</span> - when
the&nbsp;Fluorescence or Bright Field&nbsp;mode is chosen the detection
is done by the <a href="camera.htm">camara</a>. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pah4</span> - not yet
available. <br>
<b><br>
<br>
</b><big><b>Camera settings</b></big> - these controls are
duplicated from the <a href="camera.htm"> camera</a>
control panel.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Live</span> - this indicates
a succession of
integrated snaps at the exposure time.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exp.</span> - exposure time.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snap</span> - snaps am
individual image.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Binning</span> - Pixels in
the vertical and horizontal direction are calculated and combined. For
example 2 x
2 means that that two pixels in the horizontal and two pixels in the
vertical direction are combined to a single pixel. The result of
binning is that (per&nbsp;pixel) the intensity is increased while the
resolution is decreased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><b>Stage<br>
<br>
</b></big>The stage section gives an updated display of the stage
position. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Store XYZ</span> -&nbsp; the
co-ordinates displayed will be
stored to memory. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">GoTo XYZ</span> -&nbsp; will
drive
the <a href="Stage.htm">stage</a> to the stored in&nbsp;Store XYZ.<br>
<br>
<big><b><br>
Joystick<br>
<br>
</b></big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joystick</span> -
joystick is enabled and the right LED will
turn red.
