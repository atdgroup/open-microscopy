<h2>Realtime overview</h2>

<br>
As the joystick moves (as long as the <a href="camera.htm">camera</a>
is in live mode) an image (low resolution) is displayed on the screen.
One of the uses of this mode is to keep track of areas of the slide
that have been visited and quickly return to them (by clicking on the
low resolution image).<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Load</span> - loads an old
stage scan (useful if the software suddenly crashes).<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reset</span> - clears the
overview image.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Disable/Enable</span> - turns the
overview image into a real-time overview panel.<br>
