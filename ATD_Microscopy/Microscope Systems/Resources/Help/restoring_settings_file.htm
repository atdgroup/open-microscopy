<p>
This page tells you how to restore a corrupt settings file to the last known working version.
In fact any file that is stored on the version control SVN server can be restored this way.
You may want to do this is you have been playing with the settings but things have gone wrong and you
want to start again from known working versions, or if the settings file has become corrupt due to some file system error.
It all depends on good working settings being committed to the SVN server after major changes in the settings, which has
been the practice of developers on this project.

<p>
All ATD microscopes will have the code located in C:\Devel\ATD\
Use Explorer to navigate to the settings directory of the microscope you are on, i.e. for Abbe, go to:<br>
C:\Devel\ATD\ATD_Microscopy\Microscope Systems\Abbe\trunk\bin\Microscope Data
</p>

<p>
Rename or recycle the offending file. In a space in the Explorer main window panel, away from the files, right-click and select "SVN Update"<br>
This will restore the last known working version of the file.

These instructions require the code to be checked out from an SVN server and the computer to have TortoiseSVN installed. All microscopes should be this way.
