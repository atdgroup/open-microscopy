<p>
This page tells you how to acquire a prompt or IRF for time resolved processing.
</p>

<p>
You need to arrange for the laser to be working at approximately it's normal power and the PMT to be counting photons at near the imaging rate. 
We also need to let the laser wavelength reach the PMT by removing the emission filter and replacing it with about 5 ND of neutral density filters.
We assume an imaging count rate at the PMT is about 10^5 (1E5) counts per second.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the laser to the normal power, or image a normal sample to find out what normal is.</li>
<li>Replace the emission filter with about 5 ND.</li>
<li>Replace the sample with a mirror slide (or slide covered in foil).</li>
<li>Set the scan to park and ADC to required value.</li>
<li>Set acquisition time to a few seconds and press acquire.</li>
<li>Say yes to acquire a prompt.</li>
<li>Repeat acquiring a prompt and tweak the time and laser power slightly to get a prompt that peaks near 65000 but does not exceed it.</li> 
<li>Repeat for other ADC values.</li> 
<li>Repeat for other filter sets (there is no evidence that these will be different but ...)</li>
