<h2>Microscope

The main microscope panel provides the most commonly used controls.
More options are available via the 'Components' menu, as well as
individual panels for the elements already shown. The 'Configure' menu
offers some calibration possibilities.<br>

bla bla bla<br>
</b><b>objective</b><br>
<b>cube</b><br>
<b>path</b><br>
<b>camera settings</b><br>
These controls are duplicated from the <a href="camera.htm"> camera
panel</a>
with the exception of 'No Binning'. 'Live' mode is a succession of
integrated snaps at the exposure time indicated, so if an exposure
time
of several seconds is set then, after pressing 'Snap' to return to
normal, the user will have to wait until the last integration has
completed.<br>

<b>BF lamp</b><br>
These controls are duplicated from the <a href="manual_lamp.htm">
manual lamp panel</a>.

The stage section gives an updated display of the stage position. When
the 'Store XYZ' button is pressed, the co-ordinates displayed will be
stored to memory. At any subsequent time pressing 'GoTo XYZ' will drive
the stage to these stored co-ordinates.<br>
<br>
<b>joystick</b><br>
When the joystick is enabled the led to the right of the control will
