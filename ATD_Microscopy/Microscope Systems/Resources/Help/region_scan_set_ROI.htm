  <title>Setting a region of interest</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Region of Interest</h2>
Before a scan can be carried out, the region of interest (ROI) must
first be defined. This will be a rectangular area so that a succession
of regular stage movements in the X and Y directions bring each part of
the ROI into view of the camera. To complete the task the focal plane
must also be defined to account for variation in sample height with
respect to the objective.<br>
<br>
To define a rectangular area on a plane we essentially need to specify
the lengths of the sides and its position. The ROI panel gives 3
methods to do this:<br>
<br>
<b>Corners</b><br>
Using the joystick to move to 2 points to specify opposite corners of
the rectangle is enough to define the ROI. Click on 'Set start', use
the joystick to move to one of the corners, then press 'OK' when in
position. Repeat using 'Set end'. <br>

<br>
<b>Edges</b><br>
Rather than moving specifically to 2 corners we can also use the 4
edges of the rectangle to locate our ROI. This requires moving to 4
points rather than 2 but has the advantage of not having to precisely
find the corners. In any order, and as before, use the 'Set' buttons
along with the joystick to move to any points along the 4 edges. <br>

<br>
<b>Square</b><br>
For the special case of the ROI being a square we may specify the
centre of the square and one point on the border. This is enough to
uniquely define our ROI. Again the 'Set' buttons along with the
joystick are used to set these 2 points. <br>

<br>
<b>Note: numerical input</b><br>
Rather than use the joystick to physically move to the points required
it is also possible to enter the desired co-ordinates directly. A
mixture of the 2 methods can also be used. <br>
<br>
<b>After we defined the ROI it is time to define the focal plane.</b><br>
This is necessary so that as
the sample moves in X and Y we can change the stage Z position to
maintain focus.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use points inside/outside ROI</span> -
Focusing, which requires live imaging, may expose cells to harmful UV
or cause bleaching. If this occurs inside the ROI then the cells
scanned will not be 'equal' - some will have experienced different
conditions than others. This would suggest that the better option would
be to focus by imaging cells or objects outside the ROI. This assumes
of course that there are cells to see which might not be the case.
Similarly, cells on the outskirts of the ROI may not be representative
and lead to incorrect focusing. So knowledge of the cell pattern will
help deciding which option to take.<br>
<br>
<b>Setup focal plane</b><br>
The
stage will go to the first focal position and a live image is
presented.
Use the <a href="Piezo_Z-drive.htm">Z-drive</a> to achieve focus,
moving in X and Y if necessary.
Clicking 'OK' stores the information and moves to the second point.
After 3 points have been completed a focal plane will have been
defined. The three points to which the stage automatically drove formed
an equilateral triangle which minimises error in the calculation.<br>
<br>
<b>Set fixed offset</b><br>
If it is known that the focus varies little across the ROI then it may
be desirable to simply set a single focus to define a flat focal plane.
This saves time and minimises cell exposure to the illumination. When
selected, the stage drives to a single point, the user is asked to
focus
using the joystick, and on completion this Z value will be used for any
susequent scan.<br>
<br>
<b>Checking the results</b><br>
Before initiating the scan we may like to check how well the focusing
set up is going to perform. The final tab of the ROI panel allows the
user to go to various points and see how accurate the calculated focus
position is. If, at this stage, it is found that the results are
unsatisfactory then the process can be repeated.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Possible problems</b><br>
Focusing can be a tricky business. There are 3 main sources of
problems.<br>
<br>
The 3 point procedure assumes that the objects lie on a flat surface at
some angle with respect to the plane of the stage. So we are assuming
the substrate is flat (at least across the ROI). Now if, for example,
we are looking at cells on a sheet of mylar containing media there may
be some sag in the centre due to the weight of the media and dependent
on how tightly stretched the mylar is on the cell dish. In this case
the cells will not lie on a plane but on a 3D parabolic surface and the
method will fail. Similarly, if there were a wrinkle in the mylar then
focusing on a point here will generate a spurious Z value which will
lead to an erroneous result. Possible solutions, apart from ensuring
correct construction of the cell dish, are to reduce the scan area
(since the planar approximation will hold better over shorter
distances), change the scan area position to a 'flatter' region, or to
use single point focusing in the hope that a fixed stage height will
provide adequate focusing for the majority of the cells.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the 3 point procedure requires well-spaced points to be
accurate. Any 2 points define the gradient of the plane in that
direction - how much the Z height changes over the distance between
points. Consider 2 points close together - with perfect focusing the
gradient is still well-defined. However, if there is a small error in
the Z values then the error in the gradient becomes large since any
inaccuracy is then magnified at larger distances. This situation can
arise when there are few objects at the nominal focal points and the
user has to hunt for something to focus on. Often, since a sense of
position can easily be lost when using the joystick, the user ends up
at similar locations and this situation occurs. The only real solution
here is to start again and, preferably with knowledge of where objects
are likely to be found, take care to control the direction of the stage
movement with the joystick.<br>
<br>
Somewhat related to both of these issues is when one of the focal
points is simply incorrect. If the user focuses on a foreign object
which isn't in the cellular plane, for example, an incorrect focal
plane will be set. Also, if the user moves too far from the ROI to find
an object then the planar approximation, which is a local
approximation, may no longer hold (as in the example of the sagging
cell dish).<br>
<br>
In all these situations, where focusing is not straightforward, it is
worth looking at the sample live under a non-damaging illumination to
see if there is anything unexpected or to reassess the position of the
objects of interest.<br>
<br>
Additionally, a problem may occur if the plane defined takes the Z drive beyond its
limit of travel at one edge of the slide. The microscope should warn if this happens.
In this case you should follow the instructions to refocus at a central position using 
a coarse Z drive. If the plane defined exceeds both limits of the Z drive, the software
will advise that a smaller region should be scanned. You can also make sure that the sample is not
mounted at an angle (e.g. as the cover slip is too close to the edge of the slide, and the slide it sitting 
on it, in the stage insert of an inverted microscope; the Open microscopes Abbe and Galileo are inverted).
