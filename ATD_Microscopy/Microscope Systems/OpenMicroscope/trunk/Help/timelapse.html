<BODY>
The timelapse module enables the user to set a number of points on a sample. To add a new point move the stage to the required position and then press the new point button. These point may be saved for later use using the save and load buttons.

Once a number of points have been setup the timelapse module can be set to revisit these points and then perform a user defined action.
