The Stage Scan overview should be calibrated such that the scan speed is ok, 
not too fast so that there are gaps between the images.

Settings are stored in bin\Microscope Data\StageScanData.ini

Set 
overview speed = 3
overview calib fov = 430

the speed used is = speed / calib fov * current fov

set the calib and play with the speed.
The values are read at startup.
